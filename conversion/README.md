## Doing one day

1. `python3 conversion/new_day.py 01-02`
2. Transcribe the Marathi **sentence by sentence**, in the book's **original
   orthography** — नांव, कांहीं, केलीं, नाहीं. Do not modernise. A spelling
   toggle can be added later as a transform; a silent change now is unrecoverable.
3. Set `highlight: 1` on any sentence the previous reader underlined. Where an
   underline runs across two or more consecutive sentences, give them all the same
   `group` number so they read as one passage.
4. Fill `paras` with the paragraph breaks as `[first, last]` sentence pairs.
   Together they must tile every sentence exactly once.
5. Translate. Leave `en` empty rather than guessing; the validator warns, and the
   apps degrade rather than lie.
6. `python3 conversion/validate.py 01-02`, then `python3 tools/build.py 01-02`.

## Using a local model

The tooling here has **no model dependency** — `assist.py` speaks the
OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` API using only the standard library, so it
works with Ollama, llama.cpp's server, LM Studio or vLLM. No SDK, no pip install.

```bash
# 1. calibrate on a day you already trust
cp <your scan of 1 Jan> source/pages/01-01.jpg
python3 conversion/assist.py 01-01 --model qwen2.5vl:7b
python3 conversion/score.py  01-01          # measures the model against verified content

# 2. only if the score is acceptable, run a new day
cp <your scan of 2 Jan> source/pages/01-02.jpg
python3 conversion/assist.py 01-02 --model qwen2.5vl:7b
python3 conversion/accept.py 01-02                          # read it against the scan
python3 conversion/accept.py 01-02 --promote --by "Name"    # then promote
python3 conversion/validate.py 01-02 && python3 tools/build.py 01-02
```

Configuration is by flag or environment: `PRAVACHAN_BASE_URL` (default
`http://localhost:11434/v1`), `PRAVACHAN_MODEL`, `PRAVACHAN_API_KEY`.
Use `--text-model` to translate with a different, larger model than the vision one.

Against a hosted gateway rather than a local server, set both:

```bash
export PRAVACHAN_BASE_URL=https://<your-gateway>/v1
export PRAVACHAN_API_KEY=<token>
```

## Trying one model first

Before the bake-off, look at what a single model actually returns:

```bash
cp .env.example .env && $EDITOR .env && source .env

python3 conversion/probe.py --list                                   # what the gateway offers
python3 conversion/probe.py --model nvidia/baidu/paddleocr-vl --day 01-01
python3 conversion/probe.py --model <a vision model> --day 01-01 --task marks
python3 conversion/probe.py --model X --image any.png --prompt "Extract the text."
```

`probe.py` prints the raw response, latency, token counts and `finish_reason`, saves
the full text to `content/drafts/probes/`, and then runs an **orthography check that
needs no verified day file**: it counts whole Devanagari words and reports how often
the model used the book's form versus the modern one.

Two things that check gets right, both learned the hard way:

**It counts whole words, not substrings.** ते sits inside होते and तेव्हां, हे inside
आहे. Substring counting reported a perfectly faithful page as modernised.

**Only unambiguous pairs decide the verdict.** नाहीं→नाही and कांहीं→काही are real
evidence: the modern spelling has no other reading. But तें→ते proves nothing, because
**ते is also the ordinary word for "they"** — a page about ants finding sugar will
contain ते legitimately. Six of the eleven pairs are like this. They are printed under
"ambiguous" and excluded from the verdict, so a clean transcription is not condemned
by a pronoun.

### Against the Anthropic API directly

`probe.py` speaks the OpenAI-compatible shape. The Anthropic Messages API formats
images differently, so there is a separate standalone script for it:

```bash
pip install anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
python3 conversion/probe_anthropic.py --day 01-01 --model claude-sonnet-5
```

It imports nothing from this repo — copy the single file anywhere and it still runs,
falling back to a built-in transcription prompt if `prompts/transcribe.md` is absent.

Note the two request shapes differ:

| | image block |
|---|---|
| OpenAI-compatible | `{"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,…"}}` |
| Anthropic | `{"type": "image", "source": {"type": "base64", "media_type": …, "data": …}}` |

Claude models reached **through the NVIDIA gateway** (`aws/anthropic/…`,
`azure/anthropic/…`) use the OpenAI-compatible shape — use `probe.py` for those.
This script is only for `api.anthropic.com`.

It is also the one place in this repo that needs a pip install. Everything else is
standard library.

### max_tokens

A full page of Devanagari does not fit in 1024 tokens. The default here is **8192**,
and both `probe.py` and `assist.py` warn when `finish_reason` comes back as `length`.
If a model returns half a page, that is usually the cause, not the model.

## Comparing models

Which model to use is an empirical question, not one to settle from model names.

```bash
python3 conversion/bakeoff.py 01-01 --models conversion/models.example.txt
```

Runs each model over the same page and prints one table. It refuses to run on a day
that has no verified file in `content/days/`, because there would be nothing to score
against. Drafts go to `content/drafts/bakeoff/` and cannot reach the readers.

**Rank on the MODERN column, not on char accuracy.** A model that rewrites नांव as
नाव will show 99% character accuracy and be unusable. A model with a lower character
score but zero modernisation is the better one, because its errors are visible.

Two things the table will not tell you, and you must check by eye:

- whether the translation is any good — it is scored only for coverage;
- whether the underlines are right. Confirm every mark against the scan even at
  100% F1. A mark the model invents attributes something to the previous reader
  that they never marked.

Drafts land in `content/drafts/` and **never** in `content/days/`. Only
`accept.py --promote` moves them, and it requires a name.

## Read the score, not the accuracy

`score.py` compares a draft to a verified day file. The number that matters is not
character accuracy — it is **silent modernisation**: the model writing नाव where the
book prints नांव. A simulated draft that modernised the spelling of 15 of 23
sentences still scored **99.1% mean character accuracy**. Character accuracy will
tell you the model is excellent while it quietly rewrites the text.

`score.py` detects this directly: if two sentences differ only by anusvara, or only
by anusvara and vowel length, it is reported as MODERNISED rather than as a small
error. Any non-zero count there means the transcription needs correcting by hand.

It also reports underline detection as precision/recall, and calls out **invented**
marks separately from missed ones — a false positive attributes something to the
previous reader that they did not mark, which is worse than missing one.

## Why there is no automatic OCR path

The book is set in older Marathi orthography. General-purpose OCR normalises those
spellings without saying so — and a language model does it more confidently, because
its training says Marathi looks like the modern form. A silent alteration to a
devotional text is worse than no automation. That is why model output goes to a
draft field for a human to accept, never straight into `mr`.

Underline detection deserves the same suspicion. These are hand-drawn lines under
printed Devanagari, sometimes spanning two sentences, sometimes stopping mid-clause.
A model will answer confidently and be roughly right, and "roughly right" here means
silently changing what a previous reader marked. Confirm every mark against the scan.

## What the validator enforces

Errors block a build; warnings do not.

- sentence numbers run 1..N with no gaps, and every `mr` contains Devanagari
- `paras` tile the sentences exactly once, in order
- a `group` is a consecutive run, and all of its members are underlined
- commentary anchors point at sentences that exist
- **every `{{n}}` citation in a summary points at a sentence that is actually
  underlined** — this is what keeps the short page honest about being built from
  the inherited marks
- warns when a translation, page image, named author, or Marathi review is missing
